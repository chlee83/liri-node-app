# LIRI BOT!

**LIRI** is a _**L**anguage **I**nterpretation and **R**ecognition **I**nterface_. 

LIRI works in your terminal. 
It understands what you write as long as you write in this order:

node liri.js *command* *name of item you want to search*

LIRI is able to take in 4 types of commands:
* concert-this
* spotify-this-song
* movie-this
* do-what-it-says

After each of the commands (except do-what-it-says), you have to input the item you want LIRI to search for.
An example would be: _node liri.js movie-this lion king_

Here are some images of LIRI in action
